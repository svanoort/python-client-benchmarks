# python-client-benchmarks

Benchmarking different python HTTP clients, using a small, high-performance sample API. 

## Why?

[To answer a StackOverflow question: how much does performance differ, for python HTTP clients?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32899936/95122)

This provides a Python client library benchmarking tool and a simple but high-performance API (HTTP and HTTPS) to use in benchmarking.

Oh, and of course, results in a controlled environment!

## How do I run the test server?
In one terminal:
```bash
docker run --rm -i -t -w /tmp -p 4443:443 -p 8080:80 svanoort/client-flask-demo:2.0
```
Or:
```bash
./build-docker.sh && ./run-docker.sh
```

You may beed to prefix commands with `sudo`.

The test server will expose several API endpoints, with HTTP responses on port 8080 & HTTPS (self-signed cert) on port 4443:
* `/ping` - returns "pong"
* `/bigger` - returns a fixed ~585B JSON response
* `/length/\<integer\>` - returns a fixed-length random binary response of $integer bytes. The first time this is generated and cached, then it is served from cache.

## How do I run the benchmark client?
It's a command line utility and has help via `python benchmark.py -h`

```bash
python benchmark.py http://host:port/
```

## How
On one server or system:

1. In one terminal, build & run the docker image to start a test server: `sh build-docker.sh && sh run-docker.sh`
2. In another terminal, run: `python benchmark.py --cycles 10000`
3. Tests take a few minutes minute to finish, then you can close process in terminal 1. 

## Short Summary of Results

PyCurl is much faster than Requests (or other HTTP client libraries), generally completing smaller requests 2-3x as fast, and requires 3-10x less CPU time.  This is most visible with connection creation for small requests; given large enough requests (above 100 kB/s), Requests can still saturate a fast connection quite easily even without concurrent HTTP requests (assuming that all post-request processing is done separately) on a fast CPU.

On this system:
* pycurl takes about 73 CPU-microseconds to issue a request when reusing a connection
* requests takes about **526 CPU-microseconds** to issue a request when reusing a connection
* pycurl takes about 165 CPU-microseconds to *open a new connection* and issue a request (no connection reuse), or ~92 microseconds to open
* requests takes about **1078** CPU-microseconds to *open a new connection* and issue a request (no connection reuse), or ~552 microseconds to open
* CPU-limited peak throughput with PyCurl is *roughly* 50%-100% better than requests with very large request sizes, assuming an extremely fast network connection relative to CPU (in this case several GBit)

## Benchmark Setup

* Testing with two c4.large instances in AWS, one running a client, and the other running the server. 
* All tests issued 10000 sequential requests to minimize the impact of noise
* Timing was done using timeit, to separate initial setup & library loading from actual request time. 
* For loopback tests, both are run on the same (client) system, to measure performance without bandwidth limits. 
* Logs were collected from each benchmark run, along with vmstat dumps to verify that the CPU was never fully loaded (and never a bottleneck).

Specs: 

* Amazon Linux (Fedora-based), latest update and all updates installed as of 26-Feb-2016.
* Enhanced networking, [one source](https://developer.washingtonpost.com/pb/blog/post/2015/12/02/running-network-constrained-applications-on-ec2/) suggests the c4.large has ~517 Mbps of bandwidth per host.
* Apache Benchmark confirms that ~65 MB is roughly the limit (there are rare cases where 100 MB/s connections may be observed though)
* 2 vCPUs, Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 or equivalent (8 ECU)
* 3.75 GB of RAM
* 8 GB GP2 EBS volume

## Miscellanea
* `build-docker.sh` was used to generate the docker image
* `./run-docker.sh` will launch the container

## Caveats

* This is only *one* system type and *one* operating system tested
* I am only trying GET requests to a sample API  
* I've taken pains to generate data in as scientific and clean a manner as I can reasonably manage (reporting stats over 10k requests), but do not collect per-execution data so there are no error bars
* HTTPS performance should be taken with an extra grain of salt and only used for rough comparison:
  + Many different options and configurable settings exist for HTTPS, all with varying performance
  + There are also multiple TLS/SSL implementations available for libcurl, for sanity's sake I am only testing the default one. 
  + For similar reasons I'm not testing pyopenssl use in requests (in addition to base requests settings)
